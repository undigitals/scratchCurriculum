# Maze game

# Game Objectives

To play the game we use `➡️`, `⬅️`, `⬆️`, `⬇️` arrows. When the boy 👦 touches the banana 🍌 then
there will be a message `YOU ARE A WINNER`.

Objects you need to create this game:

1. You need to draw `backdrop` -> maze
2. You need to draw `a boy` sprite -> hero of the game (banana seeker boy)
3. You need to import `banana` sprite
4. You need to draw `YOU ARE A WINNER` sprite

These are the steps to basic game and from there, we will make it advanced.

# Step by Step explanation

So far we have been using `when🏴clicked` then start the game but this time we don't have to use that to start.

1. Step is to draw a maze: to do that you need to go to `backdrop` and choose `paint` from there you will draw it.

How to draw maze is up to you `USE YOUR IMAGINATION!` or ofcourse you can follow my design.

2. Step is to draw a boy: for this one you can `create/import/draw` you own `object/seeker` some students import `🏀` sprite
   some of them draw `robot 🤖`, it is up to your imagination.

3. Step is to `draw/import` banana: this one also up to you, you can draw `gold/banana` or import from `sprite library`.

4. Step is to write `YOU ARE A WINNER` message (you know how to do this one. 😄).

# Pay attention!!!!

1. When the `👦` boy touches any of the maze line, he should be returned the position he started (start line).
   `if touches color then go to x number y number`

2. When the `👦` touches the `🍌` message `YOU ARE A WINNER` should be appeared.
   For that create new `variable`. I call this `score`. Then `when 🏴clicked` `set score to 0`. In `👦` code `if touches 🍌? then`
   `change score by 1`. In `YOU ARE A WINNER` sprite check the `score` `if score > 0 then show message`.
