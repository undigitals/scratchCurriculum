Lambda function is a function without name or can be created without `def` keyword. Hence,
it's called anonymous function and all anonymous functions are called `lambda`. What? lol.

This function can take any number of arguments but can have only one expression.

Example:

```python
x = lambda a : a*10
print(x(10)) # 100
```

Lambda function always has to start with the`lambda` keyword and next to the keyword function
argument which `a` in above example.

Compare with python function:

```python
def x (a):
  return a*10

print(x(10)) # 100
```

Lambda function is used mostly as an argument of another functions (which is called `higher order functions or callback functions`).

Example:

```python
# Program to filter out only the even items from a list
my_list = [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 11, 3, 12]

new_list = list(filter(lambda x: (x%2 == 0) , my_list))

print(new_list) # [4, 6, 8, 12]
```

The `filter()` function takes a function and a list as arguments.
In the example above its 1st argument is `lambda` and `my_list` is the second. Lambda checks the list and if there is
a number divisible by 2. So all the numbers divisible by 2 will be return as `list`.

We can do same thing with normal functions too.

```python
my_list = [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 11, 3, 12]

def divisible(x):
  return x%2 == 0

new_list = list(filter(divisible, my_list))

print(new_list) # [4, 6, 8, 12]
```

The `map()` function is also takes a function and a list as arguments.

The function loops through all the items inside the list and for each item applies the function
then returns new list which function already applied.

```python
# Program to double each item in a list using map()

my_list = [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 11, 3, 12]

new_list = list(map(lambda x: x * 2 , my_list))

print(new_list) # [2, 10, 8, 12, 16, 22, 6, 24]
```

Now let's see it without `lambda`.

```python
my_list = [1, 5, 4, 6, 8, 11, 3, 12]

def multiply(x):
  return x*2

new_list = list(map(multiply, my_list))

print(new_list) # [2, 10, 8, 12, 16, 22, 6, 24]
```
