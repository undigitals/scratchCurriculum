# Problem 1

Remove a exclamation mark from the end of string. For a beginner, you can assume that the input data is always a string, no need to verify it.

example:

```python
remove("Hi!") === "Hi"
remove("Hi!!!") === "Hi!!"
remove("!Hi") === "!Hi"
remove("!Hi!") === "!Hi"
remove("Hi! Hi!") === "Hi! Hi"
remove("Hi") === "Hi"
```

# Problem 2

Your goal in this problem is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

```python
array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
```

# Problem 3

Simple challenge - eliminate all bugs from the supplied code so that the code runs and outputs the expected value. Output should be the length of the longest word, as a number.

There will only be one 'longest' word.

Here is the code:

```python
def find_longest(string):
spl = str.split(" ")
longest = 0
i=0
while (i > spl.length):
if (spl(i).length > longest): longest = spl[i].length
return longest
```

# Problem 4

You are given a list of character sequences as a comma separated string.
Write a function which returns another string containing all the character sequences except the first and the
last ones, separated by spaces. If the input string is empty, or the removal of the first and last items would
cause the string to be empty, return a null value.

Example:

```python
(array(''), None)
(array('1'), None)
(array('1, 3'), None)
(array('1,2,3'), '2')
(array('1,2,3,4'), '2 3')
```

# Problem 5

You're running an online business and a big part of your day is fulfilling orders. As your volume picks up
that's been taking more of your time, and unfortunately lately you've been running into situations where you take an order
but can't fulfill it.

You've decided to write a function fillable() that takes three arguments: a dictionary stock representing all the merchandise
you have in stock, a string merch representing the thing your customer wants to buy, and an integer n representing the number of
units of merch they would like to buy. Your function should return True if you have the merchandise in stock to complete the sale,
otherwise it should return False.

Valid data will always be passed in and n will always be >= 1.

```python
stock = {
    'football': 4,
    'boardgame': 10,
    'leggos': 1,
    'doll': 5,
}

fillable(stock, 'football', 3) True
fillable(stock, 'leggos', 2) False
fillable(stock, 'action figure', 1) False
```

# Problem 6

Write a comparator for a list of phonetic words for the letters of the greek alphabet.

A comparator is:

a custom comparison function of two arguments (iterable elements) which should return a negative, zero or positive number depending on whether the first argument is considered smaller than, equal to, or larger than the second argument

(source: https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#sorted)

The greek alphabet is preloded for you as greek_alphabet:

```python
greek_alphabet = (
    'alpha', 'beta', 'gamma', 'delta', 'epsilon', 'zeta',
    'eta', 'theta', 'iota', 'kappa', 'lambda', 'mu',
    'nu', 'xi', 'omicron', 'pi', 'rho', 'sigma',
    'tau', 'upsilon', 'phi', 'chi', 'psi', 'omega')
```

Example:

```python
greek_comparator('alpha', 'beta')   <  0
greek_comparator('psi', 'psi')      == 0
greek_comparator('upsilon', 'rho')  >  0
```

# Problem 7

It's a well known fact that anything Chuck Norris wants, he gets. As a result Chuck very rarely has to use the word false.

It is a less well known fact that if something is true, and Chuck doesn't want it to be, Chuck can scare the truth with his massive biceps, and it automatically becomes false.

Your task is to be more like Chuck (ha! good luck!). You must return false without ever actually using the word false...

Go show some truth who's boss!

```python
def ifChuckSaysSo():
    # code here
```

Example:

```python
ifChuckSaysSo() #returned False
```

# Problem 8

Write a function which converts `Hex` number (given as a string) to decimal number.

```python
hex_to_dec("1"), 1
hex_to_dec("a"), 1
hex_to_dec("10"), 16
```
