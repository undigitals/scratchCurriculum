You understand what it is, right?

Using ✏️ pencil we draw and using color buttons we can change the pencil color. Lightning helps us to clear(erase all) the space(canvas).
Plus and minus helps us to make pencil to draw thicker or thinner. Did not understand? You can see it for yourself.
Go to `Finished project` section on the right side and click the flag to start.

Objects you need to create in this game:

1. You need to draw `backdrop` -> maze
2. You need to draw `a boy` sprite -> hero of the game (banana seeker boy)
3. You need to import `banana` sprite
4. You need to draw `YOU ARE A WINNER` sprite

These are the steps to basic game and from there, we will make it advanced.
