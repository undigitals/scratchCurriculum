The syntax of the `get()`

```python
dictionary.get(key, default = None)
```

# Parameter(s)

Dictionary's `get()` method takes two parameters the first one is the name of the `key`,
the second one is optional which is by default `None`.

# Return Value

If the `key` which is given as the first argument of `get()` method is not exist in dictionary
then by default the return value will be `None`. But if you have given the second argument for the
`get()` method then the return value will be that argument.

1st example:

```python
dict = {
  'name': 'Joseph',
  'age': 25
}

print(dict.get('name')) # Joseph
print(dict.get('phoneNum')) # None
```

When we run the example above with `print(dict.get('phoneNum'))` the result will be `None` as in `dict` (Dictionary) there is no
`key` named `phoneNum` and we have not given second value for `get()` method.

2nd example:

```python
dict = {
  'name': 'Joseph',
  'age': 25
}

print(dict.get('phoneNum', 0))
```

In the second example es you have already guessed it the result will be `0` as we have specified that here `dict.get('phoneNum', 0)`.
